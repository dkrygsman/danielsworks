### Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slug Invaders is an FPGA VGA displayed Verilog game based on the classic video game space invaders. Slug Invaders is the final project of UCSC's CSE 100 Logic Design course and consisted of creating the game entirely from scratch coded in Verilog. The game was coded on Vivado IDE and programmed on the Basys 3 FPGA development board. The Critieria for consisted of a moveable player who is bound by the screen and must avoid falling "ships" which after a second of landing on the floor despawn except for it's point which stayed for another two seconds. The "ships" which are just shaped as blocks with a different colored point in the middle must be of random location on the screen and consist of a randomly selected size from 6 different options. The seven segment display is incremented as the player gathers points and the boarder around the screen flashes when the player touches a ship and dies. 

### Approach

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slug invaders consists of many moving parts when refering to digital components such as counters, multiplexers, ring/non-ring selectors, etc. All of these components were coded intirely from scratch and properly tested with timing diagrams and used throughout the course for this project. For the sake of relivance I will only be describing in detail the high components such as the state machines. \
