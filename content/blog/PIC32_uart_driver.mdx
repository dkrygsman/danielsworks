### Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For UC Santa Cruz's electrical engineering program, a concentration of communication signals and systems, or electronics and optics must be chosen and a respective design elective based of the concentration. I chose electronics and optics with the design elective ECE 121, Microcontroller System Design. The final project for this course was to create a uart driver for the PIC32 microcontroller. This involved understanding the hardware architecture of the PIC32 and understanding how to interpret the family reference manual to design a uart driver that interfaces properly to the hardware.

an interrupt service routine function that using the hardware rx and tx registers and populates two instances of circular buffers, one for rx and one for tx (recieve and transmit). A package parcer state machine is created in code that cycle through the incomming charators and parcing and checking the data to respective variables, i.e. length, ID, payload, checksum, etc.
