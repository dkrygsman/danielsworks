 # Introduction 

 UCSC's Electrical or Robotic Engineering B.S. degrees need to complete a senior exit reqirememt either a thesis or a capstone project. Without already being involved in a research lab and not having a topic to write a thesis about, the capstone project is the more common option. The capstone series consists of three quarters so en entire school year, not counting the summer quarter. The format of the series involves the first quarter being for research and understanding the appropriate ways to conduct standardized engineering, settling on a project, and assembling a team, while the other two quarters are for prototyping, testing, and presenting. Royce Shoi, Gonzalo Tiscarero, Isabella Almarez, and myself made up the beverage service robot team and our goal was to develope a low cost autonomously navigating robot for resturaunt beverage service. The break up of this project was Royce responsible of the mechanical role, building the chassis and bot shell, Gonzalo responsible of power, such as desgining a power regulator and overall system for our needs, Isabella in responsible for electrical, such as testing and interfacing sensors, and myself responsible for software. For the sake of relivance, I will only be discussing my specific work for the project and only explain their work for context of my role.

 ### Software Archietecture 

 Based off the project goals which will heavily require mapping and navigating in complex and changing envirements, we chose to use ROS2. We are running ROS on an onboard Raspberry Pi, and offboard laptop. Due to Open Robotics clear and helpful resources we chose to run the newest distribution at the time, ROS2 Iron, running on its supported Ubuntu distribution 22.04 jammy. ROS is appealing to projects like ours because it splits a complex robot up into "nodes". These nodes add a level of abstraction to the robot as a whole, making the information not needed for other nodes invisible and only publishes the information that is. The nodes in question can be split up into three groups, sensor nodes, actuator nodes, and software nodes. The sensor nodes are made up of a 2d spinning lidar node which configures with the A1 RPLidar, a 2d spinning lidar made by SlamTech, and a node that configures with the OAK-D-Lite distance camera. The actuator node consists of a single differential motor control node, which utilizes the ROS control framework, and the software nodes consist of nodes running visualization via ROS2's RVIZ, and mapping, navigation, and localization via ROS2's Slam Toolbox. At the start of this project, we underestimated the learning curve needed to work with ROS2 and because of this sevearly underestimated the size of my specific role software. 

### URDF 

The ROS archetecture uses a URDF or robot description file to tie all sensing and moving parts of the robot together and all bodies of the robot for collisions. This URDF file is made up of multiple xlm files in the form of macros. This is first done by creating the shape of the bot based on measurements given by Royce who designed the physical bot, because the bot was shaped as a tapered rectangle and ROS only provides shapes for rectangles, cylinders, and spheres this became a intensive process with precise measurements to create a body that closely matches our bot. ROS allows for importing STL files to give a exact shape which is something that can be utilized in the future or on other robotic projects. the moving bodies such as drive wheels and caster wheel are set as non-fixed bodies meaning they move. All bodies of the bot also have their respective monments of interia, resistance, weight which add to map to real world accuracy when testing. Bodies are also made for the lidar and camera also with respective "frames" which give the system information on where the origin of sensor data lies during visualization. Below are images for URDF file visualized and actual bot.
